"Do You Want. For Real.","The content of this article could be dismissed with a number of clichés. Bland, meaningless statements like ""live life to the fullest"" or ""﻿﻿be the best you can be"" will enormously fail to satisfy how I wish to describe the following world view. This piece is not meant to be motivational writing or serve as a profound discovery about happiness and livelihood, but rather a presentation of the way I think, set out for others to divulge, process and respond to.

From as early as I can recall, I have never quite understood the concept of <em>not</em> spending your life doing something you have an unending passion for. I mean... it just makes <strong>sense</strong> that you would, right? After all, given an average retirement age of around 62, you had better enjoy your livelihood for those 40 or so years between high school or college and the end of your career.

As I started this piece with examples of boring clichés, I'll close with a quote that I feel at least has some substance to it.

"The Night I Finally Saw Sam Beam","No other artist has captivated me as long as Sam Beam. It's fuzzy in my mind as to when I first found Sam's music, but I'm pretty sure it was between 2004 and 2005. I was first introduced with his second studio album, ""Our Endless Numbered Days"" and soon after became what I can only describe as obsessed, and largely have been ever since.

I've <a href=""http://www.last.fm/user/themikeman"" target=""_blank"">been on last.fm </a>since 2005, so my charts give a fairly accurate representation of my Iron &amp; Wine listening habits. No need to elaborate on that point, I think the charts speak for themselves.

I do wish that I had caught Iron &amp; Wine a couple of years earlier in life, or that Sam had gone a couple more years without gaining such notoriety, for at this point it's sad to think that he may never play solo acoustic shows again. Because if there was anything that the show last night at Higher Ground was <strong>not</strong>, it was quiet and reserved.

A Rhode Island-based band by the name of The Low Anthem set the mood for the night by opening with a series of beautiful, heart-wrenching tunes with some excellent instrumentation which at times included: upright bass, piano (or maybe harpsichord?), banjo,","2011-04-18 13:31:38"

Ok, ok. Let me step back, I don't want to seem like I'm hurling out insults. I am, however, trying to approach an ideology of genuine and heartfelt living from a logical standpoint. It's frustrating to me how many people I interact with every day who say generic, overused quips of dialog that, by definition, would imply an interest in the subject (namely, me) but in execution sound like they could <strong>not</strong> care less, about both their delivery of the empty words and my reaction to them.

"Settling In","This update is long overdue. It's been nearly two months now since I've moved into my new apartment. Not surprisingly, it feels like it's been about half that long. The summer is flying by in its usual manner. Despite it being as long as it has been, the past week I've <strong>finally </strong>finished up my room, by which I mean I put things on the wall and made it feel a bit more... lived in. In any case, I'll let some pictures do the talking. Here's our new place! We're on South Union St, about a 3 minute bike ride from Church St./downtown. Quiet neighborhood, gorgeous back porch with a fantastic view of the lake thanks to recently cut down trees. Big grassy backyard, flourishing vegetable garden and planters full of herbs.

"My Favorite Albums of 2010","In general, I'd say 2010 was a solid year for music. But with my tastes I suppose any year is a solid year for music. To sum up the year in the top three genres: folk, hardcore and dubstep. Of course, a lot of what I've been listening to weren't 2010 releases, so the list below may not represent that extremely well. In any case, here's my top picks for 2010 releases.

<td valign=""top"">
<h3><strong>The Tallest Man on Earth - The Wild Hunt
</strong></h3>
Having not known about Kristian Matsson prior to his latest release, ""The Wild Hunt"" came out of nowhere toward the beginning of the year and hit with me with such powerful force that it essentially diverted my primary listening habits to folk for the entire year. This album is flawless, from the first sound of his delicate strumming and unmistakable voice to the last note of the closing piano ballad.

<h3><strong>Good Old War - Good Old War</strong></h3>
Being as that I was already a huge fan of Good Old War, their second release was an album I looked forward to for quite some time. Luckily, the wait did not disappoint. This is one of those albums that you never thought could improve on such an amazing previous release, but does.

<h3><strong>Small Houses - Our Dusking Sound</strong></h3>
I first heard Jeremy Quentin's music after being invited to a house show at an acquaintance's house in Burlington. Since then I have seen him play his music at three or four different shows and listened to his debut release an unmentionable number of times. His next album, due out in early 2011, will undeniably be on my list of favorite albums for the next year.

<h3><strong>James Vincent McMorrow - Early in the Morning</strong></h3>
James Vincent McMorrow is one of those artists that you wish would continue making incredible music without ever becoming mainstream. An artist that you want all to yourself, relatively speaking. But, nonetheless, an artist that you know will soon be discovered by the press and receive a plethora of recognition for their work. Look for James Vincent McMorrow in music news in the coming year, he's going to make some waves.

This album isn't on here just because these are some of my best friends from back in Connecticut. This is on here because I honestly feel that this is some of the best new hardcore I've heard in 2010. Manners is serving up a modern brand of hardcore that sits alongside other acts like Defeater and Verse. With their second release in a year slated for a January 2011 release, I would expect great things for these guys in the next year.

<h3><strong>The Wonder Years - The Upsides</strong></h3>
Before The Wonder Years released their second full length album ""The Upsides"", no pop punk band had ever managed to breach that inner circle of music for me that goes beyond simple enjoyment to the extent of inspiring and leaving a profound impact. The departure from their debut LP, which primarily contains songs about generally silly or absurd topics (see: ""'Bout to Get Fruit Punched Homie""), brought them into a completely new light for me and many other fans, and the result is a powerful, down-to-earth album.

<h3><strong>Listener - Wooden Heart</strong></h3>
My introduction to Listener and Dan Smith's self proclaimed ""talk music"", something I'd rather refer to as poetry set to folk music, came in the form of a music video released by ""The Chariot"". Odd, I realize, given that The Chariot is a metalcore band. In any case, I soon afterward got hold of Listener's new release ""Wooden Heart"" and have cherished it since. Each song on this album carries more lyrical content than some entire albums, and none of that is filler. Smith's words express concepts and feelings that I have never in my life seen put into words so elegantly. After listening to Listener's older material, I realize that Smith comes from a hip hop background, and that this 2010 release is one of his first releases that leans more toward folk music. Needless to say, I think it's a fantastic direction for his music.

<h3><strong>Four Year Strong - Enemy of the World</strong></h3>
There is not much for me to say about this album. Since the first time I heard them, Four Year Strong's style of pop punk hardcore has had me ensnared. It's catchy. It's energetic. It's a live show that I will see countless times and not once have a bad experience (speaking of which, the December 26th show in Worcester, MA will mark my 7th time seeing these guys). Following an amazing label debut with ""Rise or Die Trying"", ""Enemy of the World"" takes what they established with their earlier material and pushes it to new levels. Four Year Strong goes to show that sometimes music doesn't have to have profound lyrical and musical content to be extremely enjoyable.

<h3><strong>Photographers - Songs in Ursa Minor</strong></h3>
At the time of writing this, I have only known of Photographers for two days. That being said, I did not hesitate for a second to put their recent release ""Songs in Ursa Minor"" on this list. The five songs on this EP are pure enjoyment. I've seen their sound described as ""fairytale"" music, and I would not disagree. Though this duo is relatively new, their sound is refined and marvelously crafted to create sounds that make me want to lay in the grass and empty my mind or cuddle up in a warm bed while snow falls outside.

I came across Deerpeople through a music community I am a member of where they were giving away their debut S/T EP for free. Being as that it was free music, I downloaded it, not thinking much of it and perhaps foolishly not expecting anything amazing. As it turns out, Deerpeople's first release is some of the best new indie rock I've heard this year, and I've grown quite fond of this EP over the past 6 months. Their sound is difficult to describe as it draws influences from a wide variety of genres and artists. Best to listen to the track below, my favorite off the EP.

The next few months have some great releases in store, including new music from all-time favorites Iron &amp; Wine, as well The Decemberists, The Mountain Goats, and Death Cab For Cutie. Stay tuned for news on these and more releases as we dive headfirst into 2011!","2010-12-20 15:30:30"
"Un-Resolutions","""So this is the new year, and I don't feel any different. So this is the new year, and I have no resolution."" -Death Cab for Cutie

Hey, me neither! Well, I suppose you could say I have -one-, but it's not suited to being called a resolution.

Starting in 2011 I am abandoning the concept of a ""new year resolution"" in favor of what I've decided is a mentality more suited for me. Namely, I refer to the state of continual improvement, growth, learning and loving, independent of something as trivial as the change in the calendar year. I've never been a huge fan of resolutions at the start of the year because it feels forced and a bit like an implication that change can only come at the start of a new year. So, though it may not need to be stated, I feel like for personal reasons I want to finally give a big middle finger to this concept and declare my resignation from the new year resolution club.

I posted my initial thoughts on Facebook earlier this week and my friend Garrett pointed out that the concept I am referring to coincides very well with the definition of the Sanskrit word ""Namaste"" (which ironically enough was used continually through Lost, easily my favorite series ever).

""I honor the place in you in which the entire Universe dwells, I honor the place in you which is of Love, of Integrity, of Wisdom and of Peace. When you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me, we are One.""

Although I had never seen this definition before, I think Garrett made a great connection. Namaste references the love and wisdom I specifically referred to, and implies a sort of completeness in the place where love, integrity, wisdom and peace come together.

I read a <a href=""http://freelancefolder.com/how-to-make-sure-your-new-years-resolutions-succeed/"" target=""_blank"">great article on Freelance Folder</a> last week that talked specifically about creating resolutions for your career, but also was clear about the importance of not setting hard deadlines for yourself. Since I really like the elegance with which this next piece was written in the original article, I'll quote it directly:

""I suggest instead of letting our beginnings and endings be dictated by the calendar we should allow our lives to flow from day to day, year to year without a beginning or an ending to each one. Each day is full of potential and possibilities, and so is the next one. So why proclaim a success or failure based on which day it dwells in?""

So there you have it. In 2011, resolve to ditch new year resolutions. Resolve instead to continually learn, grow and better yourself and to love all people and animals with the same passion as you would your family. If you want change in your life, do it with confidence, an undeterred spirit, and no prerequisites.

Lazerdisk Party Sex is composed of Chad Bechard (Pres) and Zach Johnson (ZJ), two Burlington-based artists. Lazerdisk Party Sex is also... well... sex (and if you haven't clicked the play button above yet, you should probably do that now). <!--more-->When Pres and ZJ joined forces in 2010, they both had plenty to bring to the table, Pres being a mashup/remix producer and ZJ with 11 years as a turntablist.

And not just some amateur music festival... a music festival that is bringing in headlining names like Pretty Lights, Edware Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Local Natives, Portugal the Man and Bassnectar, among others.

"A Simpler Time","""Things were simpler back then.""

You've heard this before, and maybe even said it. It is an expression that implies nostalgia for a time in the past when we had no responsibilities and no stresses. Just as much as the next person, I too can remember endless summers involving little more than playing outside with close friends. These were the days of snack time and recess; gym teachers that judged nothing more than your ability to have fun; kickball; beach days and summer camp. For homework, cover some paper in glue and dump glitter on it. Yes, simpler times they were.

I've thought a lot recently about the concept of nostalgia and how it is typically expressed alongside a wish to return to the times that are the subject of nostalgia. Personally, I must firmly acknowledge that I would not choose to go back to such a time. Not for a second in my thinking about this topic did I wish to be back in a time when I had no responsibilities and no stress.
<!--more-->

Think back: as a child, how often do you remember seeing something... anything... and being able to<em> appreciate</em> it? Would we, as children, even have understood what appreciation really meant? Would we have even known the word? Could you have stood at the top of a cliff overlooking a valley stretching hundreds of miles in front of you and understood what that meant to you? You may remember a moment as a child when you realized the love you felt for your mother, father or other family member. I will certainly not deny that the emotions felt by children toward their parents are those of love, but I am prone to say that this is an unconditional love that any child would feel for the people that raise, care for and nurture them. To be able to appreciate what love is, and the magnitude of those feelings, is entirely different, and requires one key element that we lacked as children: experience.

Experience serves as a reference point for everything we feel in our lives. I will always maintain that it was not until I moved out of my house at age 18 that I began to fully understand the<strong> magnitude</strong> with which I loved and cared for my family. Not being around my parents each day, while it did offer a newfound freedom, really put into perspective how much they had done for me in the eighteen years I had been living, and how much I missed having them around all the time. While I obviously loved my parents prior to leaving home, it was leaving that helped me understand the reasons for that love.

When I think about the idea of being able to rid my life of stress, or alternatively maintain that stress (which is often self-induced, more on that in a minute) and all of the experiences that have come with years of life, it seems obvious to me that I would much rather choose the latter.

One interesting thing to note is that many of the stresses in my life at this time are self-induced. With school now over and a relatively stress free (but excellent) job acquired, I have no right to complain about any stress I feel on a daily basis (and if you know me well, you know I don't). The self-induced stresses I bring upon myself by doing freelance work outside of my full-time job are simply more experiences, ones which also allow me to learn incredible new things which can only lead to more fulfilling experiences further on in life.

While this type of reflection may not be interesting to others, or seem incredibly obvious, I feel it important to recognize this in words, for me. I am nostalgic quite often, but I leave nostalgia at simply a fond memory and never as a wish that things hadn't changed, or that they were different now. Allow me to close with an obvious yet suitable explanation (even if it is cryptic outside this context):

If I were there again, I wouldn't be here. And if I hadn't gotten here the way I did, I wouldn't be who I am.

"Silhouettes","From my bedroom I look west toward Lake Champlain. Through the trees I can see the horizon on the opposite side of the lake. On a clear night like tonight I can see the colors of the sunset, broken up by the silhouetted noise of the trees in between, lines crossing every which way, creating a patchwork of oranges and blues.

For whatever reason, these silhouettes feel distinctly like winter to me. In the summer months, darkness accompanies night and a time for sleep, whereas in the winter, when darkness first falls, it is not quite nighttime yet. Depending on the month, it is barely dinner time for most people. The period of time in between is, for sure, unique to winter. Darkness falls around us and we continue with our day in that darkness for much longer than we often do in the summer.

Here's a quick folk playlist I put together to keep you warm through the rest of this beautiful yet bitterly cold winter. If you like what you hear, support these artists, because they're all incredible.

"Eats: Black Bean Burgers","My first food post on the new blog! Anybody close to me knows that cooking is an important thing to me. It's more than a way to provide sustenance. It's relaxing, it's creative, it's rewarding. And, generally, the result tastes EXCELLENT.

Last night I made a recipe for black bean burgers. It was my first time making black bean burgers from scratch, but it's something I've been meaning to get around to for months now. I found a recipe almost at random using google, settling on one that seemed a bit more unique than others which used hummus and oats, among other things, as the binding agent for the burger. The recipe turned out to be very simple, and worked great. The result was delicious, and I'd recommend to anybody who has a thing for beans, which I sure do.

"Acorntribe Debuts 'Before You Go'","Waiting for me at home this afternoon was a manila envelope addressed to me from Watsonville, California. I already knew what was inside. I had been waiting eagerly for this since early January. Inside I found, as expected, a copy of Acorntribe's new (and first) album release, titled 'Before You Go'. I had been in touch with Acorntribe's Chris King and he graciously agreed to mail me a copy from the west coast. I wasted no time copying the CD onto my computer, and after preparing some food to eat, I sat down to listen (If you want to skip my jabbering, <a href=""http://withawe.com/acorntribe-before-you-go#listen"">jump to the end to listen to the album in its entirety</a>).

<!--more-->

I sit writing this now after my first listen through.

""Before You Go"" contains eight tracks of well composed, diverse folk music that would be considered excellent music even for an established artist, never mind a debut act composed of two young people (and we're talking still-finishing-up-high-school young).

The album opens with the song that initially turned me on to Chris and Kathleen back in November, ""Before You Go"". Previously the only version released was a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQLhbrg5jtQ"" target=""_blank"">Youtube video of the song</a> being played in a bedroom, and while there were obvious compositional differences, I immediately loved the recorded version. The album recording of the song introduces percussion and a much bigger sound than I had before experienced, with more complex guitar work and banjo and violin weaving in and out of Chris and Kathleen's harmonizing vocals.

The album continues with ""A Simple Man"", a track full of delicate finger picking and soft harmonies. The lyrics ring close to home, discussing the urge to live life fully and avoid missing out on experiences.

""Lonely is the Night"" comes on next, a three minute solely acoustic track. The single guitar line and two part self harmonies remind me faintly of William Fitzsimmons or Sam Beam's early work.

The opening of ""The Rest"" was familiar as it had been featured in a teaser studio update released last month. Having watched that video and listened to the clip several times, I had a good feeling that this track was to be one of my favorite on the album, and I was correct. ""The Rest"" features a range of instruments including guitar, piano and banjo, with percussion parts entering during the buildup of the track. Again, Kathleen's voice shows up at just the right time to provide an amazing compliment to Chris's tenor.

As ""Once in the Winter"" began I was reminded of Kristian Matsson's quick finger-picking rhythms, with their subtle complexities. Just as it started to sound as if this were to be another guitar-only piece, banjo and piano entered out of nowhere and continued to build up the energy of the track until percussion appropriately kicked in to create an amazing chorus of instrumentation and soaring vocals. The track finishes up with softly spoken vocals and the light finger-picking that it opened with.

While I had initially thought that the next track, ""Let It Be"", <em>may</em> be a cover of a Beatles track, I was happy to hear that it was not (not to say anything about my love for The Beatles, but I was eager to hear more original material). ""Let It Be"", the longest track on the album, takes its time wandering through verses, demonstrating excellent musicianship through violin and mandolin parts and finishes strong on a resolving pluck of a mandolin string.

""River to the Sea"" is easily the most relaxing song on the album and I found myself more than once staring off into space while I let the sound surround me. The track manages to be subdued while still maintaining its intricacies.

And finally, the album wraps up with ""Blue Skys (Carry Us Away)"". There is a good deal of harmony between Chris and Kathleen in this song, perhaps more than any other track, as well as soft violin accompaniment through most of the track. As several other tracks did, the song continues to build in energy, this time peaking with a full chorus of sound and then falling back down to the delicate vocals heard throughout to complete the album.

This album will grace my ears more than a few times in the next several days and, I have a feeling, will quickly become a regular listen. I highly recommend you listen through using the Bandcamp player below and buy the album (only $8, come on...) through Bandcamp or iTunes.

"Eats: Mock Tuna Salad","Here's a fun experiment: get a can of chickpeas, put them in a bowl, crush them with a fork or your hands (more fun) and then close your eyes and smell. You may be surprised to detect a hint of seafood... tuna perhaps? Well... if you do, it's because it does.

I was turned on to this recipe a couple of weeks ago and have made it twice now. Previous to this recipe I had made another mock tuna recipe that came out decent, but not quite like this one. The simplicity of this recipe will blow you away, but the final product is quite astounding. I'm not saying it tastes JUST like tuna salad (not that I can quite remember what that tastes like anyways) but it is damn good in a sandwich with a slice of tomato, lettuce and a dill pickle on top.

<a href=""http://yeahthatveganshit.blogspot.com/2007/08/mock-tuna-salad.html"" target=""_blank"">Here's the original recipe</a>, from the awesome blog 'Yea, That ""Vegan"" Shit'.
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>(1) 15 oz. can of chickpeas, drained</li>
	<li>1/4 cup vegan mayo (you could use less at your discretion, as the original recipe notes)</li>
	<li>1/3 cup minced celery</li>
	<li>2.5 tbsp. minced dill pickle (about 1 slice)</li>
	<li>1/2 tbsp. nutritional yeast</li>
	<li>1 green onion, chopped (I used red onion instead, just my preference)</li>
	<li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
	<li>1/2 tsp kelp powder (you can get this at City Market for Burlington folk)</li>
	<li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions (Super Complicated)</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Mash chickpeas with a fork or by hand. Combine everything else and mix.</li>
</ol>
Enjoy! And thanks to the original ORIGINAL poster of the recipe on Compassionate Action for Animals, as noted on the link above!

<strong>NOTE: </strong>Both times I have made this, I tripled the recipe with great success. The first batch lasted me about 12 (large... heavy... stuffed, if you will) sandwiches.","2011-02-10 21:06:04"
"The Life List","This is a much more personal post than other things I've been putting on this blog so far, and because of that, the likelihood of people other than myself caring about this is small. But in the nature of ""personal"" things (or so far as that term really works in the context of a publicly viewable blog) I am putting it here anyways to serve as a guide; a record book or log, of sorts. Moving on...

MTV has been running a show since early 2010 called 'The Buried Life' which follows a group of four guys as they travel around the country and tick things off their list of ""100 Things To Do Before You Die"". When I first heard about the show I was really quite excited and got a hold of a few episodes to check out. It was cool, and well executed, but still left me disappointed because it wasn't what I had been expecting. While very entertaining, list items like ""Ask Out the Girl of Your Dreams"" or ""Attend a Party at the Playboy Mansion"" wouldn't really do much for me in the way of fulfillment or satisfaction.

SO. What follows is a list of things that I intend to do before I depart from this world.<!--more--> Not all of these things are epic, and none are unachievable. None of these things have intense restrictions or prerequisites like money, job position or social status. These things are, simply put, things that I want need to do in my lifetime. My publishing this is a binding agreement with myself that these things will happen. This will be a living document, with additions noted, and dates mentioned when things are completed, with links to posts that talk more in depth about the experiences. Here we go...

In no particular order other than when I thought of them:

<hr />
<h3>Become a licensed skydiver.</h3>
Everybody wants to skydive. But I need to go further in order to do other things on this list. This is perfectly feasible. Based on prices for a Vermont-based school, I can become a licensed diver for about $1500. Worth it. I'll be starting with the first of seven training classes this spring/summer.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Licensed:</strong> No</li>
	<li><strong>Jumps:</strong> 0</li>
</ul>
<em>Added 2/17/2011</em>
<h3>Basejumping / Wingsuit Basejumping</h3>
This is the reason I need to become a licensed skydiver. Most resources I've read recommend at <em>least</em> 150 dives from an airplane before you move on to taking a First Jump Course (FJC) for base jumping. Some base jumping schools <em>require</em> that number (or more) of dives from an airplane before you can even do a FJC. More details to follow, but this is definitely down the road a bit.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Basejumped?: </strong>No</li>
	<li><strong>Wingsuit Basejumped?: </strong>No</li>
</ul>
<em>Added 2/17/2011</em>
<h3>Five Continents</h3>
This is based on the more updated thinking which includes six total continents: Africa, Antarctica, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America. Which five is yet to be seen. At the time of this writing (February 8th, 2011) I have not left North America. Unfortunate, I know. Let's change that.
<ul>
	<li><strong>North America:</strong> Yes</li>
	<li><strong>South America: </strong>No</li>
	<li><strong>Eurasia: </strong>No (Trip to England scheduled for May!)</li>
	<li><strong>Australia: </strong>No</li>
	<li><strong>Antarctica: </strong>No</li>
	<li><strong>Africa: </strong>No</li>
</ul>
<strong>** </strong>Bonus points for rock climbing on each of those five continents

<em>Added 2/17/2011</em>
<h3>Walk the Appalachian Trail</h3>
Last summer gave me a taste of the trail before my knees failed me. The result, of course, being that I now have some sort of obligation to myself to go back and prove it wrong. This one is going to take some planning, but it needs to happen, whether I just do it in sections or straight-through, we will see.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Walked It?:</strong> No</li>
</ul>
<em>Added 2/17/2011</em>
<h3>Learn to write with my right hand</h3>
I've always been weird in the sense that my dominant hand/foot differs between types of activities. I write and draw left-handed. I throw baseballs and generally play sports right-handed. I can kick soccer balls quite well with either foot, though strongest with my right. In any case, I'm no longer OK with my right hand not being able to do coordinated activities like writing or drawing, so I'm going to change that.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fluent Writing with Right Hand?:</strong> No</li>
</ul>
<em>Added 3/4/2011</em>

<hr />As previously stated, this will be a living post, updated as things are completed or as I decide to add to the list.

I'd love to hear from any readers about similar things that they have a real desire and passion to get done in their lifetimes. Shoot me an email at <a href=""mailto:living@withawe.com"" target=""_blank"">living@withawe.com</a>

"Kindle'd + Retro Wallpapers","It was 5am on a Saturday night, last weekend, and I finalized the decision I'd been haggling with for months: Yes. I must have a Kindle.

I've been trying to return to the amount of reading I used to do before college, and I knew that a toy, a gorgeous piece of technology, would help me do that, as sad of a fact as that may be. So I got one. And I... am enamored. Amazon has created an amazing product that makes its primary purpose, reading, AWESOME.

So naturally, one of the first things I did after receiving it was find out everything I could about cool ways to mod my new reader. <!--more-->It didn't take long to find the resources to do so, and the first thing I got working was the simple screensaver hack. By default, when you turn your Kindle off (""Sleep"" mode) it displays a random wallpaper/screensaver of a famous author. Obviously being able to put your own wallpapers into the system is way cooler. So... I began digging through my image resource library that I had compiled throughout all the art classes in college and made up a pack of wallpaper from retro and space-related content from the 50's and 60's. A lot of this content was given to me originally by a concept art professor I had while studying in Montreal, so a big thanks to him. Here's a few examples. You'll find the download at the bottom.

"Are You Happy?","I was going to wait and put this in the next Awespiration post, but I felt compelled to set it on its own. I won't make this post opinionated except to say that this infographic is a concise representation of... well... me. It just makes sense.

"Renouncing Support of Corporations","Guilt is something I tend to use to my advantage to maintain convictions. It might be an odd way of thinking, but I find I am able to stay true to my words very successfully if I refrain from doing things to avoid feeling some sort of internal guilt about it. I stop doing things that would otherwise make me feel guilty. I stop, and I stick to it.

Keeping that in mind, I'm laying out some thoughts tonight that will stand as a new set of convictions that I am going to do my very best to stick to. By the title of this post you may have already guessed what this may be about. So... to make it official and to put it out in the public for all to see and for me to always be able to reference and stand by my convictions...

<strong>To the best of my abilities, I am no longer going to buy products sold by corporations. Forever. What does this include, in my eyes? Here's a list, by no means exhaustive: Walmart, Target, BestBuy, Shaws, Stop &amp; Shop, Costco, CVS, Home Depot, Rite Aid, Nike, Adidas. Global Edge has a good list of corporations by sector (click on an industry, then select Corporations on the left side).</strong>

For the most part, my consumer participation in businesses such as these is already low, but I just feel the need to lay it out a little more firmly for myself. Just needed to get thoughts out on this topic.

I also want to mention a presentation (about a completely different issue) that I would invite everybody to watch, if so inclined. I was reminded today of this talk and ended up watching the entire thing over again because it's just that engaging and informative. Not trying to force anything on anybody, as usual, but I do think that Gary Yourofsky is the type of speaker that can change opinions and lives.

"Evolution of Self","Lately I've been struck by the way in which we all evolve through different world views and personal philosophies. I stood looking in the mirror last week, on a morning the same as most. And suddenly, almost as if it were a revelation, I saw myself from the viewpoint of my high school self. A reserved 16-year-old looking at a 22-year-old college graduate. It was a person I didn't even know, with a lifestyle so far removed from my norm of high school life. If I had seen this person, my future self, at that age, and spoken with him, I would have walked away confused, lacking understanding for the ways in which he thought about the world and lived his life day to day.

We usually chuckle at the remarks of extended family or friends of our parents when they say how much we've changed since the last time they've seen us. It's not something we notice. I remember several times my parents seeing an old friend of mine for the first time in a few years, and remarking on how much they've changed, and not being able to see the same change in that person. Even so, these type of remarks are typically referring to a change of appearance. It seems that a change in personal philosophies is something we notice even less unless we truly stop and look hard at our personal evolution.

Because when you think about it, these changes happen in a flash. Minute changes to our worldview and moral stances happen <strong>every day</strong>. And how could our views <em>not</em> change constantly? Between advertising and peer influence and personal experiences, we become balls of clay from a young age, our surfaces and our consistencies reflecting the outside forces working upon us. Whether a conversation, movie, book, dream, advertisement, news article, or piece of art, a single instant is all it takes to change our shape.

And so, as I stood looking at myself in the mirror, I was suddenly mystified at how I had become who I <strong>have</strong> become. We change as people so quickly that we rarely look at ourselves objectively and wonder how it is that we arrived at our moral and philosophical views. How is it that I came to follow a vegan lifestyle, or call myself an atheist, or ascribe to a humanist worldview? On the surface it's easy enough to say that it's because I care so deeply for animals, or that I trust rational thought over blind faith, or that I innately believe in the goodness of all people. But deeper than that surface level, there are so many other things that led to those destinations. Roads running parallel to one another, coming from all different places, intersecting and weaving, merging and splitting, and eventually becoming one and arriving here: Michael Fowler, year 2011.

This post isn't about some great discovery. I didn't suddenly realize anything profound regarding my own moral and philosophical evolution. I just... wonder. Wonder how, and just plain old wonder, in awe of the complexities and expanse of our brains. Nevermind feeling humble compared to mountains and oceans and the universe... we should all feel humbled by the fact that we, as a human race, will probably never fully comprehend the capabilities of our own brains. How is it that nature has created such a complex thing as to not even be comprehended by its own user?

But then again, why would we want to? Without these mysteries there would not be nearly as much fun found in such simple yet complex mysteries.

I'll leave it at that.

"Summer Approaches, With Plans","It's always tough going to work and sitting next to a window all day. During the winter it's not too tempting, being as it's bitterly cold outside. But as summer approaches (my head refuses to recognize spring... it's a direct jump), the weather outside is looking more and more appealing. Today, for instance, it's clear and sunny outside, and I can only look out longingly. It might not be very warm yet, but the birds' voices in the air are telling me that the annual warming of our state is coming. And with that change, so also comes infinite thoughts of plans...

Come June I'll be moving residence again. I'm excited to move a bit further into the downtown area so I'm within walking or biking distance of everything I need. This summer, even more than last, I'm setting a goal to use my car as little as possible, both to conserve gas, which seemingly has started pushing toward $4.00/gallon again, but also to simply allow myself more time to spend out of doors, away from work and monitors.

Last summer was a bit of a disappointment as far as hiking, camping and climbing. The 6 days spent on the Appalachian trail was a superb experience but left my knees in rough shape. I've been doing my best to build muscle and strength in and around my knees since then, and this summer will hopefully allow for much more activity than last.
<h2>Hiking/Camping</h2>
I wanted to do this last summer, but, as I mentioned above, my body was having none of it: hike the tallest peaks in Vermont. I've <a href=""http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/highest-peaks.asp?s=VT"" target=""_blank"">found a pretty solid list of peaks</a>, so I think I'm going to start working through those as soon as it's warm enough and enough snow has melted off the mountains. There are hiking trails on nearly all of these peaks, and most can be done as day hikes, and even if not, there are camping sites to use on most trails.
<h2>Climbing</h2>
Last summer I didn't get outside to climb nearly as much as I had planned, and I'm hoping to change that this summer. I'm doing my best to get a climbing crew together, so if you're in Burlington and you want people to climb with, speak up!
<h2>Skydiving!</h2>
As mentioned in my <a href=""/life-list"">ongoing bucket list post, The Life List,</a> this summer I'll be embarking on my mission to become a licensed skydiver and (eventually) base jumper. I'm not sure how many classes I'll be able to afford this summer as they're pretty expensive (around $200 for each, seven in total), but I'm excited to just experience it for the first time.

I could undoubtedly go on about other things I hope to be doing this summer, but you'll hear about more as it happens, so I'll leave it at that. Bring the warmth!

"More Thoughts on Corporations","In recent weeks I continued to give thought to the things that I buy on a weekly basis. I thought more about the implications of my <a title=""Renouncing Support of Corporations"" href=""http://withawe.com/renouncing-support-corporations"">previously stated renouncement of corporations</a>. When I put that post initially I was essentially emptying thoughts from my head and getting them out as quickly as possible and hadn't gone through to think more about particular things that I would effectively be giving up. So I began making a mental list of specific ways in which corporations are in my life right now, and I wanted to solidify that here. I'm trying to break it down into categories, so here's what I've got...
<h2>Groceries/Beer</h2>
For the most part I buy my groceries at City Market, and almost everything I typically buy is in bulk. Being that I live in Vermont, I have no excuse (nor a want) to drink beer produced by a corporation like Anheuser-Busch, so that front is completely clear. The biggest thing I can think of as far as food goes is the occasional stop at a gas station to pick up something to drink or munch on. I eat pretty healthy, but I'm certainly guilty of soda and chips once and a while, and unless you're in a grocery store (and even then, only co-ops usually), it can be tough to find a local brand of soda and chips on the road. Cutting corporation-produced chips and soda out shouldn't be a big deal, and is probably just a healthier choice to begin with. Another on-the-road situation is stopping at a place like Subway if there are no other options for an actual meal. It doesn't happen too often, so not too big of a deal.

<em>In the past month I have not purchased any food items directly produced by a corporation.</em>
<h2>Electronics/Hardware</h2>
After thinking more about this one, I've come to the realization that it's almost impossible. Manufacturers of electronics are almost exclusively corporations: Apple, Microsoft, Asus, Sony, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Dell, Motorola, Panasonic... just to name a few. I would love to be able to say that I won't support any of those companies, but in some cases I won't have much choice.
<h2>Gas</h2>
There's not much to say for this category. Gas companies are corporations. All of them, at least around here. The best I can do is not support (with the exception of buying the actual gas) the convenience stores which always accompany the gas station.
<h2>Restaurants</h2>
I'd hate to live in a place where this wasn't easy. Burlington has a <strong>lot</strong> of great places to eat for when I do feel like going out. The closest I would come to choosing a big business would be Boloco, but they're certainly not considered a corporation.
<h2>Banking</h2>
I am happy to say that I recently became a member of Vermont Federal Credit Union! With that, I am now a member of two banks, still having an account in Connecticut, and both are locally owned (community owned in the case of VFCU).

<hr />

And that's really it as far as things that affect me on a day-to-day basis. Buying groceries is certainly the biggest way in which I've been cutting our corporations, and even there it's not been too hard. So here's a big middle finger to big business... <strong>I don't need you</strong>.","2011-04-13 07:22:57"
"Sprung - Spring 2011 Mixtape","There is a day toward the end of Winter when you walk outside and you smell the coming of Spring. I speak quite literally about this. It's a very real smell that smells of the Earth reawakening from its hibernation, finally preparing to spring forth from its seasonal home below the packed snow. You smell it and then... you hear it. It's that first day that you walk outside for work in the morning and you hear not the damped sound of winter, but the song of a single bird. It may just be the only one in range of your hearing, but it may as well be the only bird singing on the entire surface of the Earth, calling forth life and warmth.

"The Beauty of Simplicity","When I think about some of the best times I've had during my time in this world, very few involve extravagance. Most often these memories are of events that took place close to home, in normal circumstances, surrounded by close friends. They are the seemingly rare perfect days when responsibility and every unpleasant worry takes a backseat to... well... nothing. There's just nothing to concern you. The times that you are simply content feeling loved, by friends and by the Earth.

Perhaps it's just the annual reawakening of nature that we experience here in the Northeast, but springtime often seems to bring about or instigate these type of days. The Spring season, with its alternating periods of rain followed by precious days of sun and warmth, are gems during this time of the year. Today, and really the whole weekend, was one of those gems. For indeed, laying in the grass while the sun makes itself a part of you, can be called nothing other than simplicity. Idle conversation about nothing other than what comes to mind, cold drinks, a bike ride in the dying light of the day... it is difficult for me to express the contentedness that these type of days bring. It's truly amazing to experience the simultaneous nature of the sunshine and warm weather instilling life in both the plants and in us.

I've thought a lot about how unique our situation is here in the Northeast with regard to the changing of the seasons. It makes me wonder, for instance, if the springtime would come as such a joy if not preceded by winters that usually are wished gone by their last throes. Yet... come the end of Summer, I'm usually ecstatic for Fall and all its wonderful colors, apple season, the return of cool nights and thoughts of the swiftly approaching season of beautiful snowfall. I heard recently that Burlington was <a href=""http://www.care2.com/greenliving/10-happiest-cities-in-america.html?page=14"" target=""_blank"">polled as the ""happiest"" small cit</a>y in the country. Sometimes you wouldn't think so with the amount of griping about winter you hear from February through mid-April. But I think what I've started to realize is that maybe the harshness of the winter is a contributing factor to that happiness. Would warmth not become stale if continually present? At least in my opinion, the seasons balance themselves out in what they provide. Summer seems a unending promise of beach days and cookouts and swimming until mid-July when the temperature hits 100 and you can't move without sweating from every pore of your body. Winter starts out as a magical season where snow is the most beautiful sight you've seen, until February when you walk outside and the hairs in your nose freeze.

When it comes down to it, I think the season cycle keeps me much happier year-round than if I lived in a place where the seasons were less defined. Can you imagine trying to get excited for Christmas season and having it be 70 degrees outside? It just seems odd to me. Recognizing that the distinct definitions of the seasons in our part of the country has been a part of our childhood, and undeniably carries with it memories, smells, sounds and tastes, is healthy for us.

It seems I've wandered away a bit from my original topic, but I think it really all ties together. The simplicity of enjoying the change of the seasons is... bliss.

"England: Food Review","I've recently returned from a week in England with the fam! A great vacation that allowed for the exploration of two new places, namely London and the Cornwall towns of Treknow and Tintagel. Whenever I visit a place with a substantially difference culture than my own, I get to a lot of thinking. I'm still sorting through some of it in my head, but in the meantime I wanted to share a bit about something that many wouldn't have given too much thought to, but which for me served as a highlight of this trip: food.

My parents and sister are (mostly) vegetarian, I being the only vegan in my family. Despite that, I managed to drag them to primarily vegan restaurants two of the three nights we stayed in London. And, to my great pleasure, my dad found a great vegetarian/vegan bed and breakfast in Treknow, which we ended up staying at (read: gourmet vegan meals, two each day, for three days).
<h3>Tibbits</h3>
Link: <a href=""http://www.tibits.co.uk/e/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tibits.co.uk/e/</a>

Tibbits was our first culinary experience in London. I had taken some time to look up the most recommended veggie restaurants in the city, and this place was repeatedly mentioned in blogs and food websites. Tibbits does things buffet style: grab a plate, take what you want, pay by weight. Disregard any notions you have of gross buffet food that has been sitting out for hours on end. This is top notch stuff. They have both vegetarian and vegan dishes, and each dish is marked as such, as well as indicators for gluten-free, dairy-free, etc.

If I could remember what I had eaten, I would mention it here, but I essentially loaded my plate with any dish with the V next to it and blissfully devoured all of it, including the vegan bits that my family couldn't finish. Highly recommended.
<h3>Michael House</h3>
Link: <a href=""http://michael-house.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">http://michael-house.co.uk/</a>

Michael House is the bed and breakfast we stayed at while out in Cornwall. The B&amp;B is run out of the house of husband and wife Vanessa and Simon in the town of Treknow. The location places it just a short walk down to the beach in Trebarwith Strand and only a bit further to the touristy town of Tintagel, home of the fabled King Arthur's Castle and Merlin's Cave.

Vanessa prepares absolutely amazing dinners (two or three courses) based on your choice from her (quite lengthy) list of available meals. A really comfortable, homey feeling place to stay, great food, and welcoming hosts. If you're looking to see the countryside a bit, I would really suggest stopping through here for at least a night.
<h3>Mildred's</h3>
Link: <a href=""http://www.mildreds.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mildreds.co.uk/</a>

We stopped here for dinner on our last night in London. At the beginning of the week I had taken a late-night solo adventure to find this place so that I could satisfy my craving for a vegan dessert. I had found it, and the desserts were killer. So, we went back for a full meal.

Mildred's is a tiny little place nested in the heart of London Soho. They offer both vegetarian and vegan meals, and many options for gluten-free and wheat-free. I had some bitchin' dumplings as a starter and got their special for the night as my main meal, a sort of thai-style stir fry filled with great veggies.

&nbsp;

I really wish I'd had more time to explore the restaurants in London alone, because there are a TON of vegetarian/vegan places. Next time!

More thoughts to come on other aspects of the trip.","2011-05-27 09:41:29"
"New Skrillex + Doctor P Tracks","FINALLY! Skrillex has finally remixed some of his own solo work. From the start of his EDM career I've been dying to hear a remix of either a solo Sonny Moore track or even From First to Last, and finally it's happened. This track is still unreleased so the quality is mediocre. I could listen to an entire release of nothing but Sonny Moore and From First to Last remixes.

Secondly... last night was the Doctor P and Flux Pavilion show up at Higher Ground in South Burlington. Naturally, both of them killed it, but the highlight of the night went to Doctor P for throwing in his new(ish) remix of the Tetris theme, below now for your listening pleasure. I've heard a lot of Tetris remixes in my time, but this one may take the cake.

"Singles #1 - We Are the Tide","Welcome. Welcome, of course, to the first of a series of posts where I will simply post tracks that I'm really feeling at the moment. These will tend to be new tracks by artists that I love, and occasionally new tracks by artists that I have just discovered. So now that you know what you're reading...

Ever since I heard Blind Pilot for the first time back in December, I've been no less than obsessed with their debut release ""3 Rounds and a Sound"". It's the rare album that enters my library that can be played literally just about every day of the week and never get boring and never lose my interest as I'm driving, singing along as loud as I can, or sitting at my desk designing. And so it was, three weeks ago, that Blind Pilot released the first teaser of their upcoming sophomore album, ""We Are the Tide"". The teaser is of a track by the same name as the album, and it is phenomenal. I've been worried, naturally, that their second release couldn't follow their first effort, but if ""We Are the Tide"" is any indication of the rest of the album, my worries have been assuaged. Please, enjoy this teaser as much as I am (and yes, I realize that it's not the full track, so I included a good quality live version as well).

"Singles #2 - June on the West Coast","Tomorrow I am seeing Bright Eyes and The Mountain Goats. In the same place, in one night. I certainly can't claim to have been a fan of either of these groups (and by groups, let's be honest and say Conor Oberst and John Darnielle) for longer than the past 4 or 5 years, but the excitement I have for finally seeing these two guys is fantastic.

I had figured that most of the music I posted for this Singles series would be new stuff, but I will immediately prove that hypothesis wrong with this track. I was listening to some of the earlier Bright Eyes material this week and came across a track I had either never heard or had just previously brushed over. It's from Bright Eyes' second album, released in 1998.

<strong>I am in love with this song.</strong> Upon the first listen, it became my favorite song by  Conor Oberst. So please, enjoy ""June on the West Coast"" with me.
