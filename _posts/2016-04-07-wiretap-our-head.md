title: Wiretap our heads
---

If you wiretapped our heads<br />
and ferreted through the threads,<br />
of worries and sorrows,<br />
our hopes for tomorrow,<br />
and projected the sound,<br />
made audible, profound,<br />
weâ€™d hear in each other<br />
the fear that we smother,<br />
of failure and loneliness<br />
and death and unhappiness,<br />
a cacophony of dread<br />
just locked in our head.
