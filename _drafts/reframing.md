This post isn't about programming. At least not specifically. Interpret it as you will, but this is derived from a more abstract place. I take that back... don't interpret this as having anything to do with programming. It doesn't.<!-- more -->

Due to some recent emotional stress in my life having to do with the passing of a family member, I'm not sure how to feel about a few things bouncing around in my head. One thing that I do know, for it can sometimes take a shit situation like death to bring these realizations to the forefront, is that there is always a way to reframe the way you think about something. Not in the problem-solving sense, but in the "how does this make me feel?" kind of way. In the way that ultimately determines how you let a situation *affect* you.

Wait, stop. If you haven't listened to [David Foster Wallace's brilliant speech]() given at Kenyon College, go do that now. I mean it, and it doesn't matter whether you know his work or not. Because really, what you're reading right now is a less elegant, less poetic and more hastily written version of what David Foster Wallace so perfectly dictates in his speech.

As far back as I can remember I've found it difficult to cry over the death of a person I loved. And it's not for the lack of the emotional ties, nor an inbalance in my brain, nor anything else related to my health, at least not that I know.

My theory is that it has more to do with my discomfort at the way death is "accepted" in our culture. The way its handled and talked about. I always cringe slightly at the traditional funeral mass when the priest leading the ceremony states, in a tone only slightly more engaging than a speaker on C-SPAN, "we are here to celebrate the life of" so-and-so, and so on.
