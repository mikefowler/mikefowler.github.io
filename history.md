## 2017

I move out of my apartment in San Francisco and don't sign a new lease. I start working remotely for Airbnb, spending ⅔ of my time on the road living with friends, family, and strangers.

## 2014


## 2012

I settle into my job at Findery. I meet Kathy, we date for three months. I write a lot of letters back and forth with Cait. She moves to San Francisco, and we're dating before she's finished unpacking.

## 2011

During a one week vacation in San Francisco, I attend two job interviews for the fun of it. I leave the city with two offers and a tangle of thoughts. Two weeks later I leave my job at MyWebGrocer and move to San Francisco with one suitcase and two boxes. I meet [Jim](http://jimwhimpey.com/)—whom I will later steal the idea for this page from—on Craigslist, and we move into an overpriced apartment in NOPA. It has no living room and a kooky old landlord named Bill.

## 2010

I graduate from Champlain College with a Bachelors of Science in Electronic Game and Interactive Development: Art & Animation. I land my first post-collegiate job as a web developer for Red Barn Media Group.

## 2009

I take a semester abroad in Montreal, making a game with my closest friends. I become vegan.

## 2008

I lose 30 pounds running a mile every night. I realize I've subconsciously stopped eating meat; I become vegetarian.

## 2006

I'm accepted, early admission, to Champlain College. I graduate from high school. Kristen teaches me the soul-crushing pain of infidelity; we break up. I move to Burlington, Vermont to study art.

## 2005

I meet Kristen; we start dating.

## 2004

I pirate a copy of Dreamweaver and start teaching myself to make websites.

## 2002

I start high school in Hebron, Connecticut. I am quiet and shy; I am a nerd.

## 2001

I play Starcraft for many, many hours. Middle school is terrible; everything is awkward.

## 2000

I finish elementary school. I muster the courage to ask Jen to dance at the end-of-year dance. Vitamin C's "Graduation (Friends Forever)" plays at our graduation ceremony; my peers sob. We will not be friends forever; we are naive. Jen breaks up with me the first week of middle school.

## 1988

Hello, world. I am born, Michael Richard Fowler, in Hartford, Connecticut. Coming in heavy at 8lbs 8oz.
