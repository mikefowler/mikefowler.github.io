I'm Mike Fowler, a writer and software engineer. I work ⅔ of my time from the road, and the other ⅓ from San Francisco.

I work at [Airbnb][airbnb], where I focus on web performance. In 2015 and 2016 I helped prototype and build what eventually became [Airbnb Experiences][experiences]. Before that I helped bring [Findery][findery] to life.
