> It's your birthday, and I wasn't sure what to make you— then I heard this band in my Discover Weekly, and immediately was like, whoa, Mike Fowler.
>
> As I was about to post the album to your wall and say "Happy Birthday," I realized— for someone who so regularly goes out of his way to inspire more people than I can even count, I needed to do something more... inspiring.
>
> So, I bought the album, sped it up x2, bought 5 boxes of sparklers (the good ones with pink paper on the ends), went to a good spot to film the sunset, and share these sparklers with strangers.
>
> The sun only sets once; I had one shot.
>
> Mid-way through the first song, a couple asked me to take their photograph, just as the sun sets.
>
> Then, as it turns out, yelling "free sparklers!" without any notice is too weird, even for Portland.
>
> I left the frame to give 3 girls my age some sparklers, and with sped up music blaring in my ear, I regrettably answer their question of why I'm there with "I'm filming a music video... for a friend, it's his birthday" and realized: Oh, I look absolutely insane right now, this has gone horribly wrong.
>
> The song was nearing its end, so I ran back, clumped all 40 sparklers all of the sparklers in one wad, and swang that birthday torch around like an idiot.
>
> A spectacular failure, I felt completely awkward, but hey— I know I made at least one person smile, and it felt so right for your birthday.
>
> Happy Birthday. I hope you know how many people you make smile.
>
> (Oh, and the band is Still Parade, the EP is Fields, and this is only two of the 4 songs, I cut the second and 4th songs for this edit.)
