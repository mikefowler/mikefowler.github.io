> For your birthday, I made you the silliest Photoshop collage on the face of the planet because I don't know how to make real art. I was trying to figure out what I could make for you, so I went into our friendship on Facebook and started looking through old conversations to get ideas. I couldn't stop smiling. Our friendship is magic. My favorite comments can all be bucketed into one of three sentiments. One, is that you consistently make me feel more alive. Two, and I guess a side effect of number one, is that you help me see meaning in life. Three, you just make life a kinder, more beautiful place to be. If you look at the Facebook conversations I included in this college, you will see what I mean. From picking tulips to driving around listening to awesome music to jumping in the lake, you know how to live your fucking life. I cherish our friendship every single day because you help ground me and bring me back to what really matters. So, hopefully this collage brings you back to times in Burlington with us Facebooking each other so we could make plans to meet up and hang in or around the lake. I love you and I hope we are friends forever and ever. Happy birthday!
