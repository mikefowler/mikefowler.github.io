> Happy birthday! This photo was taking at the Dallas State Fair. Though I am not a big fan of cow manure and overpriced fried food, the photo does have meaning for me. Magical things can be seen even in the least expected of times and/or places. Here is to past, present and future my friend. Wishing you the best on your birthday!
