> Permaculture gardening is the kind of "art" that I do. I think you care about this picture because it shows the slow process of deliberately creating highly nutritious soil for growing organic foods.

> I chose this picture of my front yard because it shows the two main drought-resistant water-storage features my partner and I created during the last few years - in the foreground is a part of our hugelkultur covered with reclaimed pine clipping and the rain garden (decayed and water logged wood chips in a hole that goes down about 3 feet and rises about 3-5 feet above the soil level). Both of these features create extra spongy soil that slowly releases water to the surrounding ground when needed and otherwise soaks up water to store.

> Water supply is one key to creating self-sustaining food forests; nutritious soil is a second. In this picture, you see the balance of most raw ingredients - pine needles, cover crops, companion planting - about 3 years before it will be amazing soil. All that it needs is a bit more manure, and another layer of straw or mulch!
