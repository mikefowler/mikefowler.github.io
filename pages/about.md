I'm Mike Fowler, a writer and software engineer. I work â…” of my time [from the road]({% link pages/location.md %}), and the rest from San Francisco.

I work at [Airbnb][airbnb], where I build products for our internal community; previously, I helped conceptualize and build [Airbnb Experiences][experiences].

You can get in touch with me via email at [mike@mikefowler.me][email].
